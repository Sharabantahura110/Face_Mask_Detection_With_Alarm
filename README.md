The main objective is to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask correctly. If the system detects no mask or an improperly worn mask, it automatically triggers an alarm. This system combines OpenCV, a lightweight deep learning model, and TensorFlow/Keras, making it simple to build and train.

The model uses MobileNetV2 as its backbone architecture, which provides high computational efficiency and is suitable for devices with limited processing capability. Because of this, the system can be easily integrated into various embedded devices such as webcams and alarm systems.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected industries such as manufacturing, travel, tourism, and hospitality, while also causing a devastating human toll worldwide. This project, based on computer vision and deep learning, aims to address real-world safety challenges by enforcing mask-wearing standards in public places.

The system can detect masks both in images and in real-time video streams, making it applicable in airports, offices, hospitals, and many other public spaces. If the system classifies a person as “No Mask”, it can issue reminders or prompt further action to help minimize the spread of the coronavirus.
